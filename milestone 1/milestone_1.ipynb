    "In this part, we are converting the dataset into CoNLL-U format, which is commonly used for linguistic datasets. The CoNLL-U format lets us organize each token in a sentence with additional information, like its lemma, part-of-speech tag, and syntactic dependencies. Using Stanza’s NLP pipeline, we first preprocess every row in the dataset and then annotate it to include these features. In the function sentence_to_conllu_format, we turn each sentence into CoNLL-U structure and add some metadata for the label_sexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "After every row is converted, we use write_to_conllu function to save each dataset split (train, dev, test) as its own CoNLL-U file. This format is flexible and compatible with multiple NLP tools, which means we can use it in different steps of NLP processing. It also keeps detailed info for each token, which can be very useful for later model training and analysis.\n",
